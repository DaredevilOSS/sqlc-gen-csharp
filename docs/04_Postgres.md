# PostgresSQL
<details>
<summary>:execlastid - Implementation</summary>

Implemented via a `RETURNING` clause, allowing the `INSERT` command to return the newly created id, which can be of any
data type that can have a unique constraint.
</details>

<details>
<summary>:copyfrom - Implementation</summary>

Implemented via the `COPY FROM` command which can load binary data directly from `stdin`.

<summary>Supported Data Types</summary>

Since in batch insert the data is not validated by the SQL itself but written in a binary format, 
we consider support for the different data types separately for batch inserts and everything else.

*** `time with time zone` is not useful and not recommended to use by Postgres themselves - 
see [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME) -
so we decided not to implement support for it.
